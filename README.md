# Real Time Web Chat

I have developed a simple real time web chat application using <b>NodeJS</b>, <b>socket.io</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> 

###Prerequisites
* Download and install NodeJs - https://nodejs.org   
* Download and install MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com

###How to run on your machine?
* Download the files from the repository
* Run <b>npm install</b> command - to install all the dependencies required for the project, As package.json files helps node to install all the required dependencies
* Run <b>mongodb</b> command - use command prompt(Windows) to locate bin directory in MongoDB and run mongod (this will start your mongodb database)
* Run <b>mongo</b> command - use command prompt(Windows) to locate bin directory in MongoDB and run mongo (Create database and perform CURD operations)
* I have used port 8080 for this project, you can change the port number as per your requiremenet
* In your favourite web browser connect with the localhost:8080 - this by default opens the index file

<b>Note</b> - You can also deploy this project on WAMP, XAMP or any other server
